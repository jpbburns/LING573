146,"Found a book last year at my old apartment building. Looks like an older neighbor died and a ton of their belongings were just chucked out in the trash area.It's by Ted Nelson (of Project Xanadu fame) and titled ""The Home Computer Revolution"" self-published in 1977.Found a small blurb about it on Nelson's website, and a single seller on Amazon hustling it for the hefty price tag of $550USD. Other than that, can't get a lot of info.Is it rare? Anybody ever read it? Been sitting on my shelf for a while, and just found it again while gathering books for donation.

147,"EDIT
: Nevermind. 
Solution found.
‚ÄãHi all,Months ago, I've stumbled upon the solution that I'm now looking for but unfortunately I am unable to retrieve it. I have a remote server and a local client, which want to save a local copy of select folders. For this purpose, the local client only needs to download missing files from the remote host. However, if a file has been successfully transferred, but subsequently deleted, then the script should ignore these files.I thought I saw the solution on stackexchange where someone laid it out gracefully logging transferred files, checking whether a file exists and if not, whether this file is in the list of downloaded files.I also thought the used program was rsync, but I could be wrong about this too.It would help tremendously if I didn't have to write the entire script myself, but I get that this vague description is not enough to find it (as I've noticed myself). Does this ring a bell with anyone here?Kind regards, submitted by

 (to which all credit goes) I decided to reproduce an equivalent in Go, as exercise. I ended up with 
element
, a small program that displays the properties of elements on the command line; the prompt shows autocompletion menu that helps searching and completing elements names, as well as other little options like displaying the periodic table in ascii format or showing info for a random element (that could be used as Easter egg at shell start-up).Feedback and comments are greatly appreciated:
